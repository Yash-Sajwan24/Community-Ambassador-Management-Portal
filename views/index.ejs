                  <div class="column">
                      <p><span>Student Partner programs</span> are the initiatives taken by some big tech companies in which they try to bridge the gap between college education and skills required in the industry. The way these programs function in any college is first they make a group of enthusiastic students who are willing to learn and then assign some mentors and teachers who teach them different skills. In this way, students get a good grasp of many new technologies, and they understand how technologies and things are actually done in companies. A few students who already have some experience in these programs or some specific fields can apply for Campus Ambassador programs, as their main job is to lead or help other students by conducting workshops and seminars.

                        <span>There are many benefits of joining a student program or being a Campus Ambassador, some of them are listed <br><br></span>
                        <ul>
                          <li><span>Peer Group:</span> One of the first benefits of joining this community is a good peer group who are all willing to learn and achieve something big. <br></li>
                          <li><span>Team Work:</span> “Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.” This is a very famous saying and quite true in everyone's life". If one wants to achieve something very significant, a team of like-minded people is a must. Working on an interesting project and learning new things inculcate a feeling of trust among students which is very important in a good work environment.<br></li>
                          <li><span>Learn from Industry Experts:</span> This is probably the best thing about these student's programs, they provide some amazing people from the industry who have done really well in their field, and now students get to learn from them <br></li>
                          <li><span>Leadership, Positive Attitude, and Good Communication Skills</span> are also some skills that a student learns while being a part of student communities. Along with all these, there can be some students who perform exceptionally well in these programs and get a direct internship or job opportunities.</li>
